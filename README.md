# 🎓 Student Performance Analysis

This project analyzes the academic performance of students based on various demographic and educational attributes. The goal is to understand factors influencing student scores and predict their average performance using a regression model.

## 📁 Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle - StudentsPerformance.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams)
- The dataset includes:
  - Gender
  - Race/ethnicity
  - Parental level of education
  - Lunch type
  - Test preparation course
  - Scores for math, reading, and writing

## 📊 Project Goals

- Clean and inspect the data
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Engineer new features (e.g., average score)
- Train a regression model to predict student performance
- Use Pipelines and ColumnTransformers for preprocessing
- Evaluate model with Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Apply Cross-Validation

## 🧪 Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Scikit-learn (RandomForestRegressor, Pipeline, ColumnTransformer)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📈 Final MAE

- Validation MAE: ~0.53
- Cross-Validation MAE: ~0.51

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated

- Data cleaning and wrangling
- Feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Pipeline automation
- Cross-validation

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies:  
   `pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn`
3. Open `student-performance-analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter
4. Run all cells
